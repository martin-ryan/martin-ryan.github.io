	Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. <span class="boldquote">Explore. Dream. Discover.</span>

		My passion is interaction design, development and motion. I launched my career at Midway Games where I applied these skills on multi-million dollar titles - eventually spearheading and overseeing an integrated specialized service team. After 3 years I transitioned into advertising and with the knowledge gained from enterprise level software environments I excelled at concepting, designing and developing motion forward interactive experiences.

		When I was recruited as a Senior Digital Art Director by Arc Worldwide in 2007, I quickly noticed a disconnect between design and development. This observation would soon influence my decision to return to creating and managing the entire work flow. This specialized skill set enabled me to position myself and stand out as a Creative Technologist. Undergoing a paradigm shift Leo Burnett's largest client Phillip Morris was in need of top digital talent and I was quickly recruited into their newly established team.

		Marlboro Digital was charged with creating incomparable, premium interactive experiences, leveraging all avenues of rich media across the entire Phillip Morris portfolio. Over the next 3 years we grew the team to 30+ with efforts, most notably, culminating in Marlboro.com which now boasts over 10 million users.

		In 2010, I transitioned my role into Senior Motion Graphics Artist, with the aim of elevating my work, and gaining exposure to new brands, projects, and pitches. My new repertoire allowed me tell more captivating brand stories and eventually, as Associate Creative Director, told those stories across entire campaigns. My expertise with interaction soon landed me on Marlboro Global, where I was accountable for oversight of all digital initiatives - concepting and building the next version of Marlboro.com and Phillip Morris Mobile Apps.

		In September 2014 my hunger for growth pulled me away from the large agency routine. In order to stay relevant and produce the work I relentlessly strive for I returned to freelance. Since, I have worked with clients producing the work I love and helping their business grow. I am a perennial doer, problem solver and collaborator. I thrive in new territory, exploring the world through communication, creativity and technology.
